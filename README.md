This repository contains an analysis of taxi order cancellations using data from Gett, a leading ground transportation management platform. The project includes:

- **Data Preparation:** Merging order and offer datasets, handling missing values, and filtering relevant cancellation statuses.
- **Visualization:** 
  - **Heatmap:** Displays the density of failed orders across geographical locations.
  - **Cancellation Map:** Differentiates between orders canceled by clients and those rejected by the system using distinct markers on an interactive map.

The analysis aims to provide insights into order failure patterns, helping to identify high-density areas of cancellations and understand the distribution of failed orders.
